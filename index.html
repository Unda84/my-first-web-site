The Web, or World Wide Web (W3), is basically a system of Internet servers that support specially formatted documents. The documents are formatted in a markup language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language) that supports links to other documents, as well as graphics, audio, and video files.

This means you can jump from one document to another simply by clicking on hot spots. Not all Internet servers are part of the World Wide Web.
